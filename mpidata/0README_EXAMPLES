GeneSeqer-MPI - README_EXAMPLES                                (October 8, 2008)
________________________________________________________________________________

I. Set the number of processors (x) in the lines

set np = x

in x*.


II. Example:

(Comment out the MakeArray associated lines in xrunme if you have not generated
 the indices for ATest1 and ATest2 in ../data in a previous step.)

xrunme

  should produce out.gbA, the single processor output as in ../data, and
  out.gbA.MPIx, the output produced by the MPI version with x processors.

xdiff

  will show the differences between your output files and the supplied
  originals.  When comparing out.gbA with out.gbA.MPIx, EST sequence numbers
  could change, but otherwise the output should be identical.


NOTE: We are novices to MPI programming and this implementation is our naive
      attempt.  There may well be better ways to do this and you may be the one
      to implement them!  If you like, please let us know.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

(1) xrunme has a commented out command line version using mpirun which you can
    try if you are not using a job scheduler.

(3) gsMPIt.sh is identical to gsMPI.sh, but invokes the binary GeneSeqerMPIt
    produced in ../src with "make -f makefile.lnxMPIt".  This generates a bunch
    of time stamps that may be useful for evaluating performance of the code
    in various phases.  You may find "xtimes" useful to parse the output.
